This project is part of EDITO-INFRA ([Grant agreement ID: 101101473](https://doi.org/10.3030/101101473)):

## Goal
#### Summary of Demonstrator
The demonstrator use case (DUC) consists of a smartviewer that hosts a model to predict habitat suitability based on environmental living conditions. The smartviewer is maintained in a separate [repository](https://github.com/willem0boone/Edito_model_viewer) and is based on Carbonplan its [seaweed-farming-web](https://carbonplan.org/research/seaweed-farming)/[GitHub](https://github.com/carbonplan/seaweed-farming-web).

In this demonstrator, habitat suitability is calculated using a deterministic model that uses minimum and maximum thresholds on the environmental variables.
 The environmental parameters that are used are: 

- Sea surface temperature (Â°C)
- Sea surface salinity ()
- Bathymetry (depth in m) 

The thresholds for all variables can be adopted using slider widgets. On any changing parameter, the suitability map is updated and rendered in the viewer. Using a time slider, environmental parameters for several future climate scenarios can be accessed and converted in suitability maps.
This work is available on this [GitHub page](https://github.com/willem0boone/Edito_model_viewer). 

#### Data formatting
The environmental variable dataset used by the smartviewer, need to be provided in a specific format. To create this dataset, different sources and storage from Edito data lake are used. Two pipelines were required: 
- Downscaling large .zarr datasets to lower resolution. E.g. the bathymetry dataset is around 20GB, which is to large for the demonstrator purpose.
- Creating pyramids in which each level has increasing resolution (for optimal zooming/rendering).

## Building the site

Assuming you already have `Node.js` installed, you can install the build dependencies as:

```shell
npm install .
```

To start a development version of the site, simply run:

```shell
npm run dev
```

and then visit `http://localhost:5002/research/seaweed-farming` in your browser.

## Simulating Habitat Suitability

#### Environmental living conditions
Each environmental variable has 5 settings (sliders) that can be adjusted to user requirements / species characteristics. Four of them are related to the living preferences and limitations of the species and are described in this table:  


| Environmental value				| Situation 					| habitat suitability 		|
|-------					|-----						|------------			|
|                     .  < critical minimum  	| The species cannot survive 			| 0	   			|
| critical minimum <  .  < optimal minimum   	| Not optimal but the species can survive  	| value between 0-1 (linear) 	|
| optimal minimum  <  .  < optimal maximum	| Optimal living conditions  			| 1     			|
| optimal maximum  <  .  < critical maximum	| Not optimal but the species can survive  	| value between 1-0 (linear)   	|
| critical maximum <  . 			| The species cannot survive 			| 0     			|

The fifth slider serves to adjust the importance of this variable in the simulation.

#### Habitat suitability
The final habitat suitability is calculated as follows: 

Let \( i \) represent each environmental variable in the habitat suitability model. The habitat suitability formula is then given by:

$$
\text{Habitat suitability} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (W_i \cdot S_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} W_i}
$$

Where:
- \( W_i \) is the weight for environmental variable \( i \).
- \( S_i \) is the suitability score for environmental variable \( i \).


#### Presets
The simulation is preconfigured for 3 species which can be selected using checkboxes.

<<some reference to Rutendo/Ward: source of presets>>


#### Simulating the future
For future predictions, 3 Shared Socioeconomic Pathways can be selected. Using the time slider, the situation in 2010, 2050 and 2090 can be simulated. In these future simulations, sea surface salinity & sea surface temperature are subject to change, while bathymetry is considered static.

 
| [SSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_Socioeconomic_Pathways) 	|  Scenario 															|
|-------   								|-----------------														|
| SSP119  								| Very low GHG emissions:CO2 emissions cut to net zero around 2050. 								|
| SSP245   								| Intermediate GHG emissions: CO2 emissions around current levels until 2050, then falling but not reaching net zero by 2100.    |
| SSP585   								| Very high GHG emissions: CO2 emissions triple by 2075.    									|
